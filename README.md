## User story

* As a user I would like to insert values inside the input fields from the web page and get the results in the place where the parantheses are with respect to the selected sign so that I can use the tool as a calculator

## Requirements

* Display the result of the operations and add validation to the input forms without changing the HTML file
* The inserted text should be only numbers even if the input is of type text - make a validation from javascript
* The result text should be inserted in the DOM where the Result div is
* Create error messages if the operation fails for the following cases: result not a number, division by 0, operands are not numbers. Display the error message in the error div
